Personal Library App/Website

A personal library where you can store your books by publisher, author, collection, location, etc. You can add a photo of the book if you want. If you have loaned out books you can enter that in, with their name and date they borrowed it. You can add reviews about the book with rating.

If it was a multiple-user interaction app, then you could add friends libraries available for loaning out.

I could see it being popular with homeschoolers or book nerds, etc. Like that book review website, but more personal and a little more social media styled. But small. show off book collections, reviews, ratings, etc.
